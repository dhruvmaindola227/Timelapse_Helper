# Timelapse_Helper

It is an application that helps you calculate some of the variables like event duration , interval , clip length and the number of photos when you are shooting a timelapse using the intervalometer. You must know few variables before hand to calculate what you want to calculate. For example you should know that you want to make a timelapse that will be 10 seconds long @30fps and the interval that you are putting is 5 seconds. Maybe then you want to calculate if i want a timelapse like that how many photos i should set and for how long will the process of the camera shooting those number of photos take?(Event duration).

## Module 1 >> Home Page

Here you can select the variable that you want to calculate. Input the other variables that you must know and it will calculate and display the number of photos that you should give in your camera or the intervalometer and the variable that you selected for calculating. There are also question mark icons under the terms so a beginner can understand what that variable really means.

For example if you click on the event duration's(?) icon , a dialogue box will tell you what that means with visual aid.
